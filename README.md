Please note that this datasets comes from the [Kaggle's Fitbit tracker dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit), and it lacks necessary information to optimize this task. For example, there's no metadata accompanying this dataset. The number of respondents is limited in number, and very useful qualitative information such as age, gender, type of workout, device/app used, and also more metrics such a information necessary to assess quality of sleep are missing.

We will try to extrapolate a conclusion from the limited data available, **but would be highly recommended to expand this data gathering effort.**
